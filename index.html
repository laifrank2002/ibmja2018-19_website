		<h1>Colony Collapse Disorder</h1>
		<p>From 1972 to 2006, feral honey bees declined dramatically in the US, and they are now almost absent. The number of colonies kept by beekeepers declined slightly, through urbanization, systematic pesticide use, tracheal and Varroa mites, and the closure of beekeeping businesses. In 2006 and 2007 the rate of attrition increased, and was described as colony collapse disorder. In 2010 invertebrate iridescent virus and the fungus Nosema ceranae were shown to be in every killed colony, and deadly in combination. Winter losses increased to about 1/3. Varroa mites were thought to be responsible for about half the losses.</p>

		<h1>Why Bees are Important</h1>
		<p>Bees play an important role in pollinating flowering plants and are the major type of pollinator in many ecosystems. It is estimated that one third of the human food supply depends on pollination by bees, whether wild or domesticated. Contract pollination has overtaken the role of honey production for beekeepers in many countries. </p>
